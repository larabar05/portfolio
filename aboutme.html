	  <h4>Interests</h4>
	    <p>I love playing video games. Some of my favorites are Super Mario Galaxy, Sonic Mania, and The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time. I would love to study game design and other subjects that surround that field.<br>
		    Marine Biology is also very interesting to me and I spent over 5 years researching orcas every chance I got.<br>
		    Drawing is a constant for me and I'm never far from a sketchbook. Along with sketching, I can use multiple mobile drawing apps, Photoshop, and others to draw digitally.<br>
		    I have over 500 pictures of clouds on my phone, which is probably why it's running out of space.</p>
